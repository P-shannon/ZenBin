# Zen Bin Proposal

## What is Zen Bin?

> A zen board is a canvas that can be painted on with just water, that eventually dries leaving no trace of previous work. It's a testament to beauty in transientness. I want to make an online version of one geared towards creative writers and a particular type of diary owners who can have an outlet for creativity and/or emotions with out the commitment of making a lasting piece.

>I'm particularly poor at wireframing.

## Initial thoughts on app structure
> Two tables, users, zens, User can have multiple zens, zens can have one user
> Authentication for saving your zens and watching them go
> A landing page that shows recently released zens by other users (anonymously)
> A method of inputing text into a container while disallowing selecting and saving
> A page for watching your zens fade into oblivion

## Phases of Completion

### Phase: -2
1. App can create a zen
2. App CAN'T edit a zen
3. App can display zens
4. App can remove zens from view after a set time frame

### Phase: -1
1. App can allow users to register 
2. App can allow users to log in 
3. App allows users to create zens
4. Zens get assigned the user on creation
5. Users can see all of thier zens on one page
6. Random anonymous zens can be displayed on a page

### Phase: 0
1. Views begin showing a degree of style
2. Zens can't be copied or selected
3. Zens fade away over time until being invisible
4. Zens are destroyed upon becoming invisible
